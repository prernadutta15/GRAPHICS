1)	The screenshots of the diagrams for the various values of phi and theta are given as follows:
       
 
 
 


 
 
 


  
 

 
 
 


2)	The two column fields indicate the value of a and b:
 
  
The values of f shown in the previous page were 0, 3/8 and 1/4. This page displays values 1/2 and 5/8.

 

 
 
 

The values of f shown here are 3/4 and 1.


 
 
The first figure shows the interface and the second figure shows the orthographic projections for r= 5 with scale factor of 30.
 
This figure shows the perspective projection.



8) This shows the interface for the Sutherland Cohen algorithm:
 
The following figure shows the diagram before clipping:

 
After clipping:
 
9) The following figure shows a snapshot of the moving fan:
